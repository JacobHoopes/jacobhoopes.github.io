        <li>Hi!

            I am a recently graduated CS Major looking for work that will support me and allow me to pursue my passions for art and sustainable living.
            
            In addition to my degree, I also completed a minor in German. I have spent more than four months in the last two years working and taking classes in Germany, increasing my language proficiency and my comfort abroad. I would be thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to improve my German alongside my other skills.
            
            Reed and my diverse employment history have prepared me for the rigor of life after graduation. These years as a student and as a worker outside of the classroom have taught me to learn, communicate, and teach efficiently in each new context.
            
            I look forward to hearing from passionate people who would like help from a motivated and curious new face. Nothing would thrill me more than being able to help get good work get done well. If you do interesting work that you feel excited about, I would probably be excited to do that work along with you.
            
            Reach out if I might be able to help!
            
            Talk to you soon!
