    <p>
        This part of my website is dedicated to displaying my coding projects.
        I hope to make this available to recruiters and others who are interested in coding work I've done.
        This particular part of my website project was started on the 18th of October, 2023.
        Over the next weeks, I'll be translating, adapting, and uploading my projects to this site.
